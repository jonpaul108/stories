    <text>Hi! I'm Jonathan. Nice to meet you.
        I set up this nifty page to introduce myself.
        I'm working on projects and looking for a job, spending all
        day like most you all out there on their computer.
        I love animals, and am lucky to live in a ome with two cats, who only occassionally wake me up at night.
        Oh, yeah, I like to write short stories. If oyu are interested hop on over to the story page and ahve a read.
        They are, if I don't mind saying so, mostly pretty silly. I taught children for a loing time, and love kid's stories.
        Waht else? I also am a developer. Got a few projects in the works (including this one). Head on over to the page if you find yourself
        wondering what this guy (being me) is up to. There are a few things that will are coming your way.

        Thats it! Really, it wa great meetgin you, and I am not jsut saying that.
        See you later.
